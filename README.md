# About

This is a Google Apps script written in Javascript used for mail merging within Google docs.

## Usage

To add the script to your Google Sheet: Click Tools > Script editor to open the script editor, then copy the script code from this file into your script editor. Save and reload your Google sheet.

You'll need to replace EXAMPLEID123 and DOCUMENTNAME with the ID and name of your template document, respectively. The ID of a document can be derived from the URL:

```
